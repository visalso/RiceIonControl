#This file is a template used in creating the GUI for editing the experiment configuration. It documents all hardware and software that the program knows about. When new pieces of hardware (or configurable software) are added with new interfaces, they should be added here, together with their configuration information, if any.

#The GUI uses the "fields" dictionary to generate the configuration interface. Each field must be specified as a type. Known types are: role, path, str, int, magnitude, float, bool, and ok_fpga

#In addition to the specified fields, there is also an "enabled" field which is common to all items, so it does not need to be listed here. It will, however, appear in the resulting ExptConfig.yml file

#"software" is a dictionary of particular pieces of functionality available in the software, which have their own configuration information. For example, "Voltages" is a software feature, which must be configured by specifying its corresponding hardware. Hardware is a field of type "role," which means that the hardware can be set to any piece of hardware whose 'roles' field contains 'Voltages'.
